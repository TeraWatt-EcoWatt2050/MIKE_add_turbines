# MIKE_add_turbines
MATLAB script for adding tidal turbines to MIKE by DHI models.

This script takes a CSV file of turbine locations and adds them to a MIKE
model. It can cope with large numbers of turbines (tested with 1000), and thus
can save a lot of clicking.

Testing has been done with MIKE 2012. Later versions may work - at least until there are substantial changes to the turbine functionality - but no promises. If you use it with a later version, please let me know what happens!

If you use it in a project that leads to a report or publication I would 
appreciate credit and, if appropriate, a citation for the following paper
for which it was developed:

Waldman S, Baston S, Nemalidinne R, Chatzirodou A, Venugopal V, Side J, “Implementation of tidal turbines in MIKE 3 and Delft3D models of Pentland Firth & Orkney Waters” (in prep)

Improvements to this script are welcome.

-Simon Waldman.
